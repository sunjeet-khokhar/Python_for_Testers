# Python_for_Testers
Self learning course modules that enable Testers (from non-tech/non-coding background) to learn Python

## Backstory
We created these self learning modules as part of an internal upskilling programme that we have been running internally for our Test practice. I in my (ex) Service Lead role created this course as part of 3 step upskilling program to uplift the collective Technical capability our in Test practice.
Calum wore the Python "SME" hat and together we have co-authored the slide-decks and exercises, with him lending his expertise,better code quality and leading the classroom sessions

## Who should go through this course ?
    -- Testers who have no background or experience in coding but are curious to develop problem solving skills through coding
    -- Testers who want to take the first steps towards the "Automation in Test" career path but have not coded before
    -- Testers who want to equip themselves with Python scripting skills so that they can automate mundane day to day tasks
    -- Testers who want to convince themselves that coding is less about black magic but more about practice and analytical skills
    -- Testers who want to derive/re-enforce some self-confidence :)
